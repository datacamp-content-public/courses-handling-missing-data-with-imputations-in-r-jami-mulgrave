Hot deck imputation is a method for handling missing data in which each missing value is replaced with an observed response from what is considered a so-called “similar” unit.

More advanced methods with better theoretical properties are available for imputation, which we will cover in this course, but the hot deck imputation method is still quite popular due to its simplicity and speed.

## Why Use the Hot-Deck Imputation?

In many cases the quality of imputation with hot-deck imputation can be similar to nearest neighbor imputation, however, it is much faster.   The speed disadvantage of the nearest neighbor approach is mainly due to computing distances between all observations with missing values and the possible donor observations to find the k nearest neighbors.  Additionally, the hot deck method does not rely on model fitting for the variable to be imputed, and thus is potentially less sensitive to model misspecification than an imputation method based on a parametric model, such as regression imputation.   The hot deck does make some assumptions regarding the choice of metric to match donors to recipients, and the variables included in this metric, so it is not entirely assumption free. Another attractive feature of the hot deck is that only plausible values can be imputed, since values come from observed responses in the donor pool. Also, there may be a gain in efficiency relative to complete-case analysis, since we keep information in the incomplete cases.

If you are dealing with big data,  hot-deck imputation is a suitable imputation method.   At the U.S. Census Bureau, the hot deck procedure was developed for item non-response in the Income Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS), which was initiated in 1947 and has evolved since then.

`@script`
Hot deck imputation involves replacing missing values of one or more variables for a nonrespondent (called the recipient) with observed values from a respondent (the donor) that is similar to the non-respondent with respect to characteristics observed by both cases.  The term hot deck, in contrast with cold deck, dates back to the storage of data on punch cards. It indicates that the donors and the recipients are from the same data set; the stack of cards was “hot” because it was currently being processed (i.e., run through the card reader quickly, which heated the punch cards). Cold-deck imputation, by contrast, selects donors from external data sets.   A hot deck procedure will first sort the rows (i.e. respondents) of a data file within a set of variables, called the deck.  

For random hot deck imputation, the donor is selected randomly from a set of potential donors, which is called the donor pool.  With sequential hot deck imputation, instead of the donor being selected at random, the most recent donor value is filled in.

## How to Use HotDeck in R

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 59ba2ffad7
```

`@part1`
The synopsis of the function is :
```hotdeck(data, variable = NULL, ord_var = NULL, domain_var = NULL,
makeNA = NULL, NAcond = NULL, impNA = TRUE, donorcond = NULL,
imp_var = TRUE, imp_suffix = "imp")```

`@script`
We will use the hotdeck procedure in the VIM package in R. The most important arguments are: .
• data – a data frame or matrix, which contains the data set with missing values in some
variables;
• variable – a vector of variable names for which missing values should be imputed;
• ord_var – a vector of variable names for sorting;
• domain_var – a vector of variable names for building domains and to impute within
them.
