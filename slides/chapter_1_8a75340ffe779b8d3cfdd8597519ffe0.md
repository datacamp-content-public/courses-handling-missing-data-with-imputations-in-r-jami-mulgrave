A different way to impute is through matching.

Hot deck imputation is a method for handling missing data in which each missing value is replaced with an observed response from what is considered a so-called “similar” unit.

More advanced methods with better theoretical properties are available for imputation, which we will cover in this course, but the hot deck imputation method is still quite popular due to its simplicity and speed.

## Why Use the Hot-Deck Imputation?

In many cases the quality of imputation with hot-deck imputation can be similar to nearest neighbor imputation, however, it is much faster.   The speed disadvantage of the nearest neighbor approach is mainly due to computing distances between all observations with missing values and the possible donor observations to find the k nearest neighbors.  Additionally, the hot deck method does not rely on model fitting for the variable to be imputed, and thus is potentially less sensitive to model misspecification than an imputation method based on a parametric model, such as regression imputation.   The hot deck does make some assumptions regarding the choice of metric to match donors to recipients, and the variables included in this metric, so it is not entirely assumption free. Another attractive feature of the hot deck is that only plausible values can be imputed, since values come from observed responses in the donor pool. Also, there may be a gain in efficiency relative to complete-case analysis, since we keep information in the incomplete cases.

If you are dealing with big data,  hot-deck imputation is a suitable imputation method.   At the U.S. Census Bureau, the hot deck procedure was developed for item non-response in the Income Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS), which was initiated in 1947 and has evolved since then.
